# linkpower


The program solves the most suitable (with most power) link station for a 
device at givenpoint [x,y].

The solution resolves the problem in 2-dimensional space. Link stations 
have reach and power.

A link stationâ€™s power can be calculated:
```
power = (reach - device's distance from linkstation)^2
if distance > reach, power = 0
```
